BREAST CANCER

In this I used the sklearn dataset load_breast_cancer which is pre defined dataset in sklearn. The Malignant and Benign value indicated by M and B is indicated by 0 and 1. By using the Seaborn, the correlation data heatmap is presented from we can indicate the correlation of the data here. 
The load_breast_cancer total data is splited in to Training dataset (75%)and Test dataset (25%). 
The training dataset is trained with three models Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier.
The accuracy are:
Logistic regression training accuracy: 0.9906103286384976
Decision Tree Classifier training accuracy: 1.0
Random Forest Classifier training accuracy: 0.9976525821596244
The test data is tested in confusion matrix with Testing accuracy more than 93 %.
